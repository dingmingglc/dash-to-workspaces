  "description": "Icon taskbar for GNOME Shell with built-in workspace previews. Moves the dash into the main panel so application launchers and system tray are combined in a single panel (like KDE Plasma / Windows 7+). Includes workspace thumbnails, app icons per workspace, shortcuts bar, intellihide, and compatibility with Dash to Panel (e.g. avoid overlap).\n\nAuthor / Contact: dingmingglc@gmail.com\n\nBased on Dash to Panel. For a more traditional experience, enable Windows > Titlebar Buttons > Minimize & Maximize in Tweaks.",
